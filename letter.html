                Dear ba,
                <br><br>
                I am in love with you. You mean the world to me. You are SO beautiful and sexy! I love your beautiful long blonde hair and exquisite eyes. Your butt is like a sculpture. Your little face moles on your belly make me smile. Your toes are perfectly crafted. Your hands were made for mine like two precision puzzle pieces. Your love for pizza matches my love for pizza. Your need for exploration fuels my exploration. Your smile is infectious! I am thankful God put you in my life over 7 years ago. We have learned a tremendous amount together and I continue to grow and learn from you each day. You are such an incredible woman! Even Equifax recognizes you as distinguished - that's a huge achievement.<br><br>
                I couldn't be more proud of you! You are hardworking, giving, and compassionate. A woman who loves God, loves those around her, and wants to make the world a better place. You take direct action on your goals and have made tangible impact at Equifax through your sustainability initiatives and you have empowered hundreds of people around the globe through your resume writing. Incredible! You excite me.
                <br><br>
                "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away." - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
                <br><br>
                I miss you like crazy and can't wait to be in Costa Rica sleeping next to you. I'm super excited about all of our potential travel in 2021! We have already done so much this year. I reflect on our trip out West and that was an incredible trip. It was so different from what we normally do! But I loved seeing God's natural wonders on this Earth. They were wild! Thank you so much for doing all the heavy planning for that trip and I cannot wait to take YOU on a trip soon. I miss you in Boston, there's nothing like falling asleep next to the person you love so dearly every night.

                At the time of writing this, you are somewhere camping and I miss you like crazy. I planned to send you a big breakfast in the morning with uber eats and chocolates from the grocery store but I needed to improvise when you wouldn't be home in the morning. Then I thought, I could make you an e-valentine's day website! How fun :) I hope you're enjoying so far. Check out the other tabs for fun!
                <br><br>
                Many hugs and kisses xoxo,
                <br>
                Your boyfriend, man, best friend, partner, and lover Benjamin Pierce
